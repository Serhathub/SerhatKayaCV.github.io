I’m Serhat, a 22-year-old student currently in my final year of the Associate Degree in Programming. I’ve developed a strong foundation in C# and MySQL, and I’m highly motivated and social, always eager to expand my skills in different programming languages.

At the moment, I have solid experience with JavaScript/TypeScript, MySQL, C# (including object-oriented programming), Node.js/Express.js, and Angular. This semester (starting September 15, 2025), I’m focusing on React.js/React Native, Next.js, API development (C#-based), and Unity as part of a company project.
